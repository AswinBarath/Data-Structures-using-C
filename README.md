## Data Structures using C Lab 

1.	Demonstrating Pointers Usage
    1)	Printing Memory Addresses: Write C program to demonstrate the use of pointers by printing memory address 2. 
    2)	Writing a Swap Function: Write a C program to swap two numbers using pointers concept 
    3)	Allocating and Freeing Memory: Write a C program to demonstrate the use of allocating a memory and freeing 
    4)	Memory Leaks and Other Problems: Write a C program to demonstrate the memory leaks when pointers are not used properly.

2.	Demonstrate Strings, User defined data types and Files in C
    1)	Reading and Writing Strings: Write a C program to demonstrate the input and output operations on strings 
    2)	String operations / Manipulations: Write a C program to demonstrate the operations on strings – by writing user defined string functions. 
    3)	Enumerations, Structures and Union: Write a C program to demonstrate Enumerations, Structures and Union data types. Write a program for following using recursive methods. 
    4)	File operations: Write a C program to demonstrate the input and output operations on files

3.	Demonstrate the technique of recursion in C
    1)	Recursion – Write recursive function for i) Sum of natural numbers  ii) Factorial of a given number iii) Fibonacci sequence

4.	Stack ADT Implement Stack using Arrays 

5.	Queue ADT Implement Queue using Arrays 

6.	Singly Linked List Write a C Program to perform following operations on Singly Linked List ADT: i. Create ii. Insert iii. Delete iv. Display
